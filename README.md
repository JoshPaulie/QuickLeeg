# QuickLeeg
Crude cli to quickly get builds for League of Legends champions from '[League of Graphs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/)' ❤️

Other build sites might be supported in the future

## Features
- Fastest way to get your league build (at least from League of Graphs). More info @ [Why?](#why)
- Common champion nicknames support, with fuzzy finding fallback

## Installation
```zsh
pipx install [TBD]
```

## Usage
```zsh
leeg [-h] [-r RANK] champ lane
```
## Why?
League of Graphs is easily the superior league build site. Despite this, getting to your favorite champion's stats is one too many clicks for me. You have to
1) Load the site
2) Click search box
3) Enter champ name
4) Specify lane
5) Specify rank

This script litreally just makes this one step
